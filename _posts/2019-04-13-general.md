# Just a normal day

I woke up early today. It's just a normal day, but waking up early is quite an abnormal thing to do after coming to college. I was not sleeping much from last two or three days so I slept very early(at least for me) last night. It was a pegion that made me woke up at 6 or 6:30 in the morning, I don't remember exatly. The SAC elections are going on in the campus and I am pissed off by the idea of conducting such political event in a technical institute. Yes, I consider that it is important for the students to get familiar with how the administrative work is done but I don't think this is the way of doing this. Students started taking this thing very passionaltely but just for winning. There are no criterias on which you can actually judge somebody. Actually you don't know a person. Obviously you have some idea about some people but these are very less number of people with some reputation in college ccconsidering both good and bad image. The way politics is evolving through out the three years of my college life has not been very promising in terms of taking responsibility but it has grown up in a sense of winning the battle and defeating the downtrots(the opposition). I think there should not be any hate between differnt candidates and the team supporting them. But you can see some very dirty politics going on. Anyways, I used my vote wisely, I voted for the candidates that can better manage the work they would be given based on my own experience with them. I believe that we are a group of people in the campus who came after a lot of hard work and got selected in a very prestigious institute of our country. We should be setting up some exxample for our leaders "leading" the country currently. We should show them how the politics can also be done in a way that it is not believed to be done. Cheers!

## Farmako is the next big thing going to happen after ccration of earth

I used to sleep a lot when I was doing my intern. I lost interest in core after coming back to college and started working on my startup. I think it is going to help a lot of people globally. It is not something we are doing for money. Obviously it would bring up a lot of money with it. But I thing money is something that is considered as a bad thing like sucking blodd out of somebody's body. I don't think that making money is a bad thing and as a company, I think it is important to make money and that a lot too becuase more money you make more you can help other peolple in terms of providing better jobs and employement to unemployeds. Centralization of money is a very bad thing when it is not giving any volatitlity in the market. We should be looking forward to bring up opportunities for everyone present around. We are in a position to come up with some idea that we can execute in order to help more and more people. I think our aim with Farmako is just that to provide more and more help to evryone around and make the world a better place. Cheers!
